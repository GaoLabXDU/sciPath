Improving Single-Cell RNA-seq Clustering by Integrating Pathways
We designed a framework (sciPath) to study the accuracy and robustness of existing single-cell clustering by integrating pathways, including 10 state-of-art single-cell clustering methods and 4 pathway databases, pathway integration method and a complete set of validation indicators.

# The preparation of sciPath
1.Datasets: 
  Demo datasets are saved in ".//Demo_data", including scRNA-swq matrix (".//Demo_data//matrix"), pathway (".//Demo_data//pathway") and cell labels (".//Demo_data//label").
2.Package installation:
  The installation code of the offline package and the online package are saved in ".//package//package_install.R".
